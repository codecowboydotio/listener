# listener
This is a simple listener that will print the IP address of the remote computer an the time.

I wrote this in response to working on firewalls and needing to know the external address of a server before and after NAT changes.

TODO:
1) Change the logfile name to be a command line argument (i.e. configurable).
2) Add option for proper syslog logging.
